      "content": "\n      <p>There's this idea that when you start something new—especially something as challenging as writing—you have to be perfect. You look at the blank page, and you freeze. You want the first sentence to be a masterpiece.</p>\n      <p>But here's the truth I learned: the first wave is never perfect. It's usually messy, uncoordinated, and sometimes, it knocks you right off your board.</p>\n      <p>When I first started surfing, I spent more time underwater than on the board. I swallowed saltwater, got bruised, and felt ridiculous. But every time I fell, I learned something about the ocean. About balance. About timing.</p>\n      <p>Writing is the same. Your first draft is that first clumsy wave. It's essentially you trying to find your footing. And that is perfectly okay. In fact, it's necessary. You can't edit a blank page, just like you can't steer a stationary surfboard.</p>\n    ",

      "excerpt": "Surfing might look like a physical sport from the outside—and sure, it is. But deep down, it's about seeing the world differently.",
      "content": "\n      <p>Surfing might look like a physical sport from the outside—and sure, it is. It's about paddling strength, balance, technique. But anyone who's spent time in the ocean knows there's something deeper going on. Surfing forces you to be present. You can't control the waves, so you learn to adapt. You're not racing anyone, so you focus on your own rhythm.</p>\n      \n      <p>It's a lesson in patience and humility. You could spend an hour waiting for the right wave, only to miss it. You could wipe out twenty times before you finally stand. And yet, you keep going. You learn to laugh at your mistakes. You begin to enjoy the silence between sets.</p>\n      \n      <p>In <em>Finding Waves</em>, I explore how that shift in mindset—letting go of control, embracing the moment—helped not just my surfing, but my everyday life. The ocean became a teacher. And the lessons stuck with me long after I left the water.</p>\n    ",
