      <p>There's this idea that when you start something new—especially something as challenging as writing—you have to be perfect. You look at the blank page, and you freeze. You want the first sentence to be a masterpiece.</p>
      <p>But here's the truth I learned: the first wave is never perfect. It's usually messy, uncoordinated, and sometimes, it knocks you right off your board.</p>
      <p>When I first started surfing, I spent more time underwater than on the board. I swallowed saltwater, got bruised, and felt ridiculous. But every time I fell, I learned something about the ocean. About balance. About timing.</p>
      <p>Writing is the same. Your first draft is that first clumsy wave. It's essentially you trying to find your footing. And that is perfectly okay. In fact, it's necessary. You can't edit a blank page, just like you can't steer a stationary surfboard.</p>

        title: "Why Surfing Isn't Just a Sport—It's a Mindset",
        excerpt: "Surfing might look like a physical sport from the outside—and sure, it is. But deep down, it's about seeing the world differently.",
        content: `
      <p>Surfing might look like a physical sport from the outside—and sure, it is. It's about paddling strength, balance, technique. But anyone who's spent time in the ocean knows there's something deeper going on. Surfing forces you to be present. You can't control the waves, so you learn to adapt. You're not racing anyone, so you focus on your own rhythm.</p>
      
      <p>It's a lesson in patience and humility. You could spend an hour waiting for the right wave, only to miss it. You could wipe out twenty times before you finally stand. And yet, you keep going. You learn to laugh at your mistakes. You begin to enjoy the silence between sets.</p>
      
      <p>In <em>Finding Waves</em>, I explore how that shift in mindset—letting go of control, embracing the moment—helped not just my surfing, but my everyday life. The ocean became a teacher. And the lessons stuck with me long after I left the water.</p>

      <p>When you see authors on social media effortlessly publishing bestsellers, it's easy to forget the struggle behind the scenes. We see the book signing, the cover reveal, the 5-star reviews. We don't see the rejections, the late nights, the deleted chapters.</p>
      <p>If I could go back to the beginning of my writing journey, I'd tell myself three things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Consistency beats intensity.</strong> Writing 200 words a day is better than writing 5,000 words once a month.</li>
        <li><strong>Reading is part of the job.</strong> You can't output good words if you aren't inputting good words. Read everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Your voice is your superpower.</strong> Don't try to sound like Hemingway or Rowling. Sound like you. That's what people connect with.</li>
      </ol>

       <p>Surfing doesn't give you a choice about failure. You fall. Constantly. Sometimes in front of everyone. You paddle for a wave, miss the drop, and go tumbling into the whitewash.</p>
       <p>In the beginning, I was embarrassed. I felt like everyone on the beach was watching my clumsiness. But then I realized something: nobody cared. They were too busy watching the waves or dealing with their own wipeouts.</p>
       <p>Failing forward means accepting that the fall is part of the ride. You can't learn to stand up if you aren't willing to fall down. Every wipeout taught me how to adjust my weight, where to look, when to pop up.</p>

      <p>There’s a special kind of freedom that comes from being in the ocean. It’s not just physical; it’s a mental release unlike any other. When you are out past the break, sitting on your board, bobbing with the swell, the noise of the land fades away.</p>
      <p>There are no emails, no notifications, no deadlines. Just the horizon, the wind, and the water. It's a form of meditation in motion. You are forced to be completely present, because if you aren't, the ocean will remind you.</p>
      <p>Finding this freedom was accidental for me. I was looking for a sport, but I found a sanctuary.</p>

      <p>When I left the UK with a backpack and a camera, I didn't have surfing in mind. I was looking for stories. I wanted to meet people, see landscapes, and write about the world. But found waves instead.</p>
      <p>It happened in a small coastal town in Portugal. The hostel offered cheap lessons, and I thought, "Why not?" That single decision changed the trajectory of my travel. Suddenly, my destinations were dictated by swell charts rather than guidebooks.</p>
      <p>Travel opens you up to these serendipitous moments. You think you're going one way, and a single wave pushes you in a completely different, beautiful direction.</p>
